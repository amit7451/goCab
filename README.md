## 🛠 Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

| Tool | Version | Download |
|------|---------|----------|
| Node.js | v18+ | https://nodejs.org |
| npm | v9+ | Bundled with Node |
| MongoDB | v6+ | https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community |
| Git | Latest | https://git-scm.com |

---

## 🚀 Setup Guide (Step by Step)

### Step 1 — Clone or download the project

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> GoCab
cd GoCab
```

Or unzip the downloaded folder and `cd` into it.

---

### Step 2 — Start MongoDB

#### Option A: Local MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine:

```bash
# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew services start mongodb-community

# Ubuntu/Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod

# Windows
# Open Services and start "MongoDB"
# OR run: net start MongoDB
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
mongosh
# You should see the MongoDB shell prompt
exit
```

#### Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud — Recommended for production)
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/atlas
2. Create a free cluster
3. Get your connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.xxx.mongodb.net/gocab`)
4. Use this as your `MONGO_URI` in Step 4

---

### Step 3 — Set up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

---

### Step 4 — Configure Backend Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gocab
JWT_SECRET=change_this_to_a_long_random_secret_string
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

> **Important:** Change `JWT_SECRET` to any long random string before deployment.
> Example: `JWT_SECRET=x9$Kp2mNvQ8rT6wY1uA4bE7hJ3cL0sD5`

---

### Step 5 — Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Development mode (auto-restarts on file changes)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚕 GoCab server running on port 5000
✅ MongoDB Connected: localhost
```

Test the API is alive:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Response: {"status":"GoCab API is running"}
```

---

### Step 6 — Set up the Frontend

Open a **new terminal** window:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

### Step 7 — Configure Frontend Environment (Optional)

The frontend uses a Vite proxy by default so **no env file is required for local development**. The proxy in `vite.config.js` automatically forwards `/api` requests to `http://localhost:5000`.

If you want to point to a remote backend:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit VITE_API_URL to your backend URL
```

---

### Step 8 — Start the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  VITE v5.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

---

### Step 9 — Open the App

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5173**

## 🔐 Authentication

All protected routes require a **Bearer JWT token** in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

The frontend handles this automatically via the Axios interceptor in `src/api/axios.js`.

---

## 💰 Fare Calculation

Fares are calculated server-side in `Ride.js`:

| Ride Type | Base Fare | Per Km Rate |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Economy   | ₹30       | ₹12/km      |
| Comfort   | ₹50       | ₹18/km      |
| Premium   | ₹80       | ₹25/km      |

> Note: Distance is currently simulated (2–22 km random). In production, integrate Google Maps Distance Matrix API.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**CORS error in browser?**
- Make sure `CLIENT_URL` in `.env` matches your frontend URL exactly (no trailing slash)

**MongoDB connection failed?**
- Ensure MongoDB is running: `mongosh` should open a shell
- Check the `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file

**Port already in use?**
- Kill the process: `lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill` (macOS/Linux)
- Or change the `PORT` in `.env`

**JWT errors after password change?**
- Clear `localStorage` in the browser developer tools and log in again

**"Driver profile not found" error?**
- This means the user registered with `role: driver` but no `Driver` document was created
- Re-register or check the `register` controller for errors
